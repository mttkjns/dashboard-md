*Quitman; Clay; Randolph; Calhoun; Terrell; Dougherty; Lee; Worth; Turner; Tift; Ben Hill; Irwin; Early; Miller; Baker; Mitchell; Colquitt; Cook; Berrien; Seminole; Decatur; Grady; Thomas; Brooks; Lowndes; Lanier*
Special Weather Statement issued June 22 at 5:13AM EDT by NWS Tallahassee FL
High fire danger conditions are expected today over Southwest and
South Central Georgia. This will be due to several factors,
including near-record triple digit temperatures, unseasonably low
relative humidity values of 18-25 percent, and an unstable air
mass characterized by very high mixing heights. Afternoon winds
will be north to northeast at 5 to 10 mph.

Dead fuels will dry quickly. Live fuels will become stressed and
wilty.

Please refer to your local burn permitting authorities whether
you may burn outdoors. If you do burn outside, use extreme
caution.

Relative humidity values of 25 percent or lower will develop for
several hours this afternoon and evening in Northeast Georgia.
Fuel moisture likely will fall below 8 percent across much of the

Georgia, despite winds being light.

Please refer to your local burn permitting authorities to
determine whether you can burn today. If you do burn, exercise
extreme caution.
