**WIDESPREAD HEAT INDEX VALUES IN THE TRIPLE DIGITS EXPECTED THIS AFTERNOON FOR THE MAJORITY OF NORTH AND CENTRAL GEORGIA**

Special Weather Statement issued July 9 at 5:36AM EDT by NWS Peachtree City GA
Heat index values are expected to reach between 100 and 105
degrees across the forecast area this afternoon, primarily between
noon and 6 PM outside of mountainous areas of northeast Georgia.
However, cooler air from several lines and waves of showers and
thunderstorms will be possible throughout the day which could
bring some early relief to the oppressive heat.

Isolated locations across the forecast area may even reach Heat
Advisory criteria of heat index values over 105 degrees where
skies break and outflows from showers and storms are unable to
reach until late afternoon, however, at this time confidence is
low for any particular area where this would occur.

High temperatures are expected to be lower today than in previous
days, with highs 'only' in the low 90s expected. A frontal passage
tonight is expected to keep highs in the upper 80s for Sunday,
bringing further relief to a long stretch of extreme heat for the
area.
