## Active Alerts for GA

**FLOOD ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 AM EDT THIS MORNING**
*Rabun, GA; Macon, NC*
Flood Advisory issued May 27 at 2:55AM EDT until May 27 at 8:00AM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg SC
* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues.

* WHERE...Rabun County, Georgia and Macon County, North Carolina.

* WHEN...Until 800 AM EDT.

* IMPACTS...Nuisance to Minor flooding will continue, causing common
inundation of low-water crossings, boat-access areas, campgrounds,
parks, greenways, farmland and other areas adjacent to streams.

* The Little Tennessee River from Franklin to Needmore is currently
exceeding bankfull and will continue to flood low-lying areas
adjacent to the river.  The river is currently cresting but at
levels just above Action/Advisory Stage Needmore Rd will be
flooding.

* The Nantahala River near Rainbow Springs is currently exceeding
bankfull and is flooding several low-water crossings.  The river
will continue to rise over the next couple of hours and may reach
6.5 feet before cresting.

* The Tallulah River above Lake Burton has crested near 7 feet and
will gradually fall through Friday morning.  Current flows are
unusually high, however, so continued impacts to adjacent
low-water crossings and along Plum Orchard Rd will continue for at
least a few more hours.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- At 233 AM EDT, The last round of shower activity is currently
departing Rabun and Macon counties after numerous rounds of
moderate to heavy rainfall over the past 24 hours.  This
rainfall resulted in areas of 3-6 inches of accumulation
across the area, resulting in significant rises along
numerous streams.  Significant flows will continue along
larger streams across the area, causing elevated flows and
out-of-bank conditions to persist into the early morning
hours.  Residents along the Tallulah River below Lake Burton,
especially below Mathis Dam need to remain alert for
potential reservoir releases due to very high flows feeding
Lake Burton.  If significant releases occur, a Flash Flood
Warning may be needed.  Please stay weather aware.
- Some locations that may continue to experience flooding
include...
Franklin, Clayton, Highlands, Mountain City, Tiger, Dillard,
Sky Valley, Tallulah Falls, Black Rock Mountain State Park,

locations. Area creeks and streams are already running high and
could easily flood with any more heavy rainfall.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Many parts of the watch area have received 2 to 5 inches of
rain in the past 24 hours, with a few locations in the
southern mountains already above 6 inches. Areas of moderate
to heavy rain showers with embedded thunderstorms will
continue and additional flooding may develop while ongoing
flooding worsens. An additional inch or two of rainfall will
be possible through daybreak in the most prone locations to
southerly upslope flow.
