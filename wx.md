**INCREASED FIRE DANGER IN EFFECT FROM 11 AM EDT THIS MORNING THROUGH THIS EVENING**
*Rabun; Habersham; Stephens; Franklin; Hart; Elbert*
Special Weather Statement issued April 27 at 3:11AM EDT by NWS Greenville-Spartanburg SC
Very dry air is moving into northeast Georgia today behind a
departing cold front. Temperatures rising into the 70s will permit
afternoon relative humidity percentages to bottom out in the
upper teens across the area. With rainfall fairly minimal
yesterday following a recent dry period, brush and other fuels
will continue to dry out. These conditions will increase fire
danger across northeast Georgia today.

Please refer to your local burn permitting authorities on whether
you can burn today. If you do burn, use extreme caution since
fires can quickly get out of hand under these conditions.
